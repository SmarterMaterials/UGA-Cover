# Grenoble Alpes University Thesis cover page
This repository provides a Latex template to create yourself the first page of your thesis.

It has been reported that mistakes can be present in the ADUM cover page. To avoid this you can create the cover page thanks to this LateX project.

This repository is based on the repository [template_UGA_manuscrit_ENG](https://github.com/nicomagnet/template_UGA_manuscrit_ENG) authored by Nicolas Magne Tang that provides a full thesis template for Universit√© Grenoble Alpes.

## How it works:
- The file "manuscrit.tex" (Manuscript file) is the base document.
- The directors, reviewers and jury names can be edited in the "manuscrit.tex" file as well as author name, thesis title and date of defense.
- The PhD specialty, lab and doctoral school can be modified within the "meta-donnees.sty" file around line 30.

## Create the pdf
The easiest way to use LaTeX is [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). 
Create an overleak account and download the .zip file of the GitHub project. 
Create a new project in Overleaf and choose upload project, you juste have to select the .zip file you just downloaded and you are ready!
